## What is this project? 
I made a wireframe and Mockup (login page, sign-up page,home page for visitor, home page for user, profile page) for such a random website.

## What are the tools you used to create it? 
I used different tools on FIGMA website to design and of course, i used prototypes to link the pages with each other.
